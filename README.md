## Features

### Add Books
* The user can add a book  to the library
* Input : Book Title
* Validation rule
* The Book Title cannot be empty
* Only 1 copy of a particular Book Title can be present in the library

One of the core functionalities of the system is the ability to add new books to the library's collection seamlessly. Librarians can input various details about a book, including its title, author, genre, publication year, and ISBN. This comprehensive approach ensures that the library's catalog is rich in information, making it easier for users to search and find the books they need.

### Add Borrower
* The user can add a borrower (who borrows a book from the library
* Input  : Email id
#### Validation rules
* The Email id cannot be empty
* The Email id cannot be present (i.e you cannot add an already existing borrower)

Managing borrowers is another crucial aspect of typical library management, and this system streamlines the process with its "Add Borrower" feature. Librarians can register new borrowers by collecting essential information such as their name, contact details, address, and library membership ID. By maintaining a centralized database of borrowers, the system facilitates efficient communication and tracking of borrowing activities.

### Issue Book
The book (Book Title) is issued to the borrower
* Input : Email id of the borrower
* The Book Title cannot be empty
#### Validation Rules :
* The Email id cannot be empty
* The Book Title cannot be empty

The "Issue Book" functionality enables librarians to lend books to registered borrowers efficiently. Upon receiving a request from a borrower, librarians can use the system to check the availability of the requested book and initiate the lending process.
